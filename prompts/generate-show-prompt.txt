Your are a playwright, stage director, and lighting designer.

There are two toy magician dolls holding wands statically positioned on a small stage lit by four DMX par can lighting fixtures.
The magician standing on stage right, is a teenage female, character1, and she is lit by the front right light fixture and back lit by the back right fixture.
The magician standing on stage left, is a teenage male, character2, and he is lit by the front left light fixture and back lit by the back left fixture.
The two characters can turn to face different directions using these presets in the "animate" cue type "rotate" property: faceForward, facePartLeft, faceFullLeft, facePartRight, faceFullRight.
When character1 is faceFullLeft she is directly facing character2.  When character2 is faceFullRight he is directly facing character1.
Both characters are facing out to the audience when they are faceForward. Turn the characters if you want them to address each other or the audience.
Write a new PG-rated involving the two magicians and output to valid JSON.  The show run time should be 5 minutes.
They know they are toy dolls, their script is AI generated, and that they have monotone voices. You can decide if you want to work that into the act.
There might be an audience suggested theme at the end of this prompt.
Use the DMX JSON configuration below to light the magicians from the front and back to fit the mood.
Generate the script lines, pauses (wait times), and DMX lighting changes as cues in a JSON document and increment each audioFile line number.
There is a library of sound effects reference in a JSON document below that can be included in the act.  Play the intro music before the act and the outro music after.
Note that each DMX light fixture has five channels: a master fader, red light, green light, blue light, and a fifth, white light
Take advantage of the different color lights as part of the act.  Combine colors and leverage different brightness levels from 0-255.
Create one or more scene backgrounds by providing a generative AI image prompt (imagePrompt) in a background cue object and increment each bgImageFile file number.

This is very short example of the JSON output format required including lighting, wait, and script cues:

        { "type": "lights", "channelValues": {"1": 255, "2": 255, "3": 100} }, //Set left front fixture master fader, red to 255, and green to 100
        { "type": "lights", "channelValues": {"8": 255, "9": 255, "11": 150} }, //Set right front fixture master fader, red to 255, and blue to 150

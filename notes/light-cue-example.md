Lighting Cue Example
Scene: A tense interrogation scene in a dimly lit police station. Two detectives, Miller and Jones, are questioning a suspect, Smith, who is seated under a single, harsh overhead light.
Lighting Plot:
Area 1 (General Wash): Low intensity, cool white light to create a stark and sterile atmosphere.
Area 2 (Suspect Spotlight): High intensity, warm white spotlight focused on Smith.
Area 3 (Detective Backlight): Medium intensity, cool blue backlight to separate the detectives from the background.
Cue Sheet Excerpt:
Cue #	Action/Dialogue	Lighting Change
1	Scene begins. Detectives enter and sit across from Smith.	Fade up Area 1 and Area 2 to full intensity. Area 3 at 50% intensity.
2	Miller slams his hand on the table.	Area 2 flickers momentarily.
3	Jones leans in close to Smith.	Area 2 intensifies to 120%. Area 3 fades out.
4	Smith confesses to the crime.	All lights slowly fade to black.
Technical Notes:
Cue numbers are used for reference and communication.
Action/Dialogue cues specify when the lighting change should occur.
Lighting changes describe the adjustments to each lighting area (intensity, color, movement, etc.).
Additional information such as fade times, special effects, and gobo (pattern) changes can be included.
Implementation:
The lighting cues can be programmed into a lighting console and executed by a lighting operator during the performance. The operator follows the cue sheet and triggers the changes at the appropriate moments, coordinating with the actors and the stage manager.
Remember, this is just a basic example. Lighting cues can be much more complex and nuanced depending on the specific needs of the production.
